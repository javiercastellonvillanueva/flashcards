**A:** Composite attributes

**Q:** True or False: An attribute that holds multiple values for a particular entity is known as a single-valued attribute.
**A:** False

**Q:** What is essential for a primary key?
**A:** It must contain unique values.

**Q:** True or False: A bridge table is required to implement many-to-many relationships in a relational database.
**A:** True

### Lecture 3: Normalization of Relational Tables

**Q:** What is the main goal of normalization in database design?
**A:** To minimize data redundancies and ensure data integrity

**Q:** True or False: Normalization involves decomposing a table into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.
**A:** True

**Q:** Which of the following is NOT a step in converting a table to the First Normal Form (1NF)?
**A:** Include derived attributes

**Q:** What condition must be met for a table to be in Second Normal Form (2NF)?
**A:** No partial dependencies on the primary key

**Q:** True or False: A table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if it is in 2NF and contains no transitive dependencies.
**A:** True

**Q:** In the context of normalization, what is a transitive dependency?
**A:** When an attribute depends on another non-primary key attribute

**Q:** True or False: Normalization only applies to relational databases.
**A:** True

**Q:** Which of the following best describes a partial dependency?
**A:** An attribute depending on part of a composite primary key

**Q:** True or False: Eliminating data anomalies is a primary concern of normalization.
**A:** True

**Q:** What is the role of a primary key in the normalization process?
**A:** To uniquely identify each row in a table

### Lecture 4: Extended Entity Relationship Model

**Q:** What is the primary goal of the Extended Entity Relationship (EER) model?
**A:** To enhance the traditional entity-relationship model with more complex concepts

**Q:** True or False: A specialization hierarchy organizes entities into supertypes and subtypes based on their relationships and attributes.
**A:** True

**Q:** What does a subtype discriminator do in an EER model?
**A:** It determines to which subtype an entity instance belongs

**Q:** True or False: In a specialization hierarchy, a subtype can have multiple direct supertypes.
**A:** False

**Q:** What is the significance of completeness constraints in an EER model?
**A:** They specify whether every supertype occurrence must be a member of at least one subtype

**Q:** True or False

: Overlapping subtypes allow an entity to be a member of more than one subtype at the same time.
**A:** True

**Q:** Which constraint ensures that an entity instance of a supertype must belong to at least one subtype?
**A:** Total completeness constraint

**Q:** True or False: Entity subtypes do not inherit attributes and relationships from their supertypes.
**A:** False

**Q:** In the context of EER models, what is the role of inheritance?
**A:** It allows entity subtypes to inherit attributes and relationships from their supertype

**Q:** True or False: Maintaining historical data in a relational database requires creating separate entities to track changes over time.
**A:** True

### Lecture 5: Creating Database Tables and Importing Data using SQL

**Q:** What is the primary function of SQL in database management?
**A:** To communicate with a relational database management system

**Q:** True or False: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is used for managing a MySQL database.
**A:** False

**Q:** Which SQL command is used to create a new table?
**A:** CREATE TABLE

**Q:** What does the `NOT NULL` constraint ensure?
**A:** That the column cannot have a NULL value

**Q:** True or False: The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint can ensure that a column (or a group of columns) contains unique values across the table.
**A:** True

**Q:** The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is used to:
**A:** Establish a relationship between two tables

**Q:** True or False: The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to add new rows to a table.
**A:** True

**Q:** Which SQL command is used to remove a table and all its data from the database?
**A:** DROP TABLE

**Q:** The `UPDATE` statement is used for:
**A:** Modifying existing records in a table

**Q:** True or False: The `DELETE FROM` statement is used to delete existing records from a table, and it can be restricted to specific records using the `WHERE` clause.
**A:** True

### Lecture 6: An Introduction to SQL Queries: From Data to Information

**Q:** What is the purpose of the `SELECT` statement in SQL?
**A:** To query data from a database table

**Q:** True or False: The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate rows from a query result.
**A:** True

**Q:** Which clause is used to sort the results of a query in SQL?
**A:** ORDER BY

**Q:** The `WHERE` clause is used for:
**A:** Filtering records that fulfill a specified condition

**Q:** True or False: The `HAVING` clause is used to filter rows after they have been grouped by the `GROUP BY` clause.
**A:** True

**Q:** Logical operators in SQL, such as `AND` and `OR`, are used to:
**A:** Combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause

**Q:** Which aggregate function is used to calculate the total sum of a numeric column?
**A:** SUM()

**Q:** True or False: The `GROUP BY` clause is necessary when using an aggregate function like `SUM()` or `COUNT()` to group the output.
**A:** True

**Q:** To select records from a table where a particular column's value is unique, which SQL feature would you use?
**A:** DISTINCT keyword

**Q:** True or False: You can use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort query results in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
**A:** True
