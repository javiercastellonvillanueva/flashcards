True or False: A specialization hierarchy organizes entities into supertypes and subtypes based on their relationships and attributes.,TRUE
What does a subtype discriminator do in an EER model?,It determines to which subtype an entity instance belongs
"True or False: In a specialization hierarchy, a subtype can have multiple direct supertypes.",FALSE
What is the significance of completeness constraints in an EER model?,They specify whether every supertype occurrence must be a member of at least one subtype

"In the context of EER models, what is the role of inheritance?",It allows entity subtypes to inherit attributes and relationships from their supertype
True or False: Maintaining historical data in a relational database requires creating separate entities to track changes over time.,TRUE
